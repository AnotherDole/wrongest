##The Wrongest Words
####(A Virtual Card Game For 3 Or More Players)


This is a javascript-based card game about trying to find The Wrongest Statement on the internet. At the beginning of every round, all players are dealt a card. Players must then briefly explain, in turn, why their statement is actually correct. Once arguments have been made, players select a Most Wrong and a Least Wrong statement.

Both players and cards collect scores as the game progresses. Having another player vote your statement Least Wrong will get you points. Cards with positive scores (more "least wrong" votes than "most wrong") will be discarded as boring. All other cards end up back in the deck, and cards with negative scores will get tagged with bonus multipliers.

### W very much I P
This is currently being built in a HTML/CSS/jQuery environment, and it will need node.js at some point to be correctly playable. Which means I need to learn node.js (and probably socket.io). If you know some of either, please contact.
